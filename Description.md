STM32CubeIde is used for building this.
In this simulation , GPIO Port A pin 0 is used as output for toggling led.
It is done using CMSIS library without using HAL.
The definitions of variables used can be found inside "Your project"-> Drivers -> CMSIS -> Device -> ST -> STM32C0xx -> Include -> stm32c031xx.h
